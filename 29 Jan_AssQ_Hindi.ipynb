Another option is to use the \"platform\" module, which provides a \"python_version()\" function.\\n\\n9.Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called?\\n\\nPython supports the creation of anonymous functions using a construct called \"lambda\".\\n\\n10.What does pip stand for python?\\n\\n\"pip\" stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\".
